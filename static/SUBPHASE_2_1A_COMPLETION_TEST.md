# Subphase 2.1a Completion Test

## 🎯 What Should Now Be Visible

After the edge and label rendering fixes, you should see:

### ✅ Visual Elements
1. **Edges/Links**: White lines connecting related artists
   - 9 total connections between the 10 artists
   - Subtle white lines (30% opacity)
   - Should connect: IU↔IVE, IU↔TWICE, TWICE↔IVE, etc.

2. **Node Labels**: Artist names on top of circles
   - White text with black shadow for readability
   - Centered on each node
   - Only visible when zoomed in ≥50%

3. **Node Borders**: White outlines around each circle
   - Makes nodes pop against black background
   - Consistent 2px stroke width

### 🧪 Quick Tests

#### Test 1: Edge Visibility
- [ ] **Action**: Look at the network
- [ ] **Expected**: See white lines connecting nodes
- [ ] **Focus**: Pink nodes (K-pop) should be heavily interconnected

#### Test 2: Label Visibility  
- [ ] **Action**: Check if artist names appear on nodes
- [ ] **Expected**: See "Taylor Swift", "IU", "TWICE", etc. as white text
- [ ] **Zoom Test**: Zoom out far - labels should disappear for performance

#### Test 3: Visual Polish
- [ ] **Action**: Examine individual nodes
- [ ] **Expected**: Each node has white border/outline
- [ ] **Expected**: Colors remain vivid (yellow for pop, pink for Asian)

#### Test 4: Zoom Performance
- [ ] **Action**: Zoom in and out rapidly
- [ ] **Expected**: Labels appear/disappear smoothly
- [ ] **Expected**: FPS remains high (100+ FPS)

### 🔍 Troubleshooting

**If edges still don't appear:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify stats show "Edges: 9" in sidebar
- Try switching to SVG renderer to compare

**If labels don't appear:**
- Zoom in (labels only show at ≥50% zoom)
- Check console for font loading errors
- Ensure nodes have valid names in data

**If performance drops:**
- Check FPS counter in sidebar
- Try reducing force simulation strength
- Verify zoom-based label culling is working

## ✅ Success Criteria

Subphase 2.1a is **COMPLETE** when you can see:
- ✅ Colored nodes with white borders
- ✅ White connecting lines between artists  
- ✅ Artist names as readable labels
- ✅ Smooth zoom/pan at 60+ FPS
- ✅ Canvas/SVG renderer switching works

This validates the core Canvas foundation before moving to genre clustering!
