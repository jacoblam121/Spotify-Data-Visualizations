# Phase A.2 Artist Verification Improvements

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Case-Insensitive Artist Matching
**Problem**: Artist names had different cases across data sources (*Luna vs *LUNA), causing verification failures.

**Solution**: Implemented case-insensitive fallback methods:
- `_get_user_tracks_for_artist()` - Tries exact match first, then case-insensitive search
- `_get_user_albums_for_artist()` - Same pattern for albums
- `_get_user_mbid_for_artist()` - Same pattern for MBIDs

**Implementation**:
- Uses `casefold()` for proper Unicode handling (better than `lower()`)
- Maintains O(1) performance for exact matches
- Only performs O(N) search when exact match fails
- Logs when case-insensitive matches are found

### 2. Adaptive Track Confidence Thresholds
**Problem**: Users with limited Last.fm data (e.g., YOASOBI with only 3 tracks) couldn't achieve track-based verification.

**Solution**: Made confidence thresholds adaptive based on available user data:
- Calculates `track_count_factor` based on user's total tracks
- Adjusts thresholds: 1-3 perfect matches required (was fixed at 3)
- Special handling for very small libraries (≤5 tracks)
- Emphasizes match quality over quantity for small datasets

**Results**:
- YOASOBI now gets STRONG_TRACK_MATCH (0.910) instead of HEURISTIC_BASED (0.465)
- All other artists maintain their verification quality

### 3. Data Loading Bug Fix
**Problem**: Float/NaN values in Last.fm CSV caused `.strip()` errors.

**Solution**: Added type conversion with fallback:
```python
artist_name = str(row.get('artist', '') or '').strip()
```

### 4. Malformed API Data Handling
**Problem**: Non-numeric listener counts in API responses caused crashes.

**Solution**: Added safe type conversion with error handling:
```python
try:
    candidate_listeners = int(candidate.get('listeners', 0))
except (ValueError, TypeError):
    logger.warning(f"Invalid listener count for {candidate_name}: {candidate.get('listeners')}")
    candidate_listeners = 0
```

Also fixed display formatting to handle malformed data gracefully.

### 5. Match Ratio Adjustment for Large Catalogs
**Problem**: Artists with large catalogs (like Taylor Swift with 119 tracks) failed track verification due to strict match ratio requirements.

**Solution**: Implemented adaptive match ratio thresholds:
- For catalogs >50 tracks: 20% match ratio required
- For smaller catalogs: 30% match ratio required

This recognizes that artists with extensive catalogs may only have their top hits in Last.fm's API responses.

### 6. Spotify Data Source Fixes
**Problem**: 
1. Heuristic scoring used direct dictionary lookup, missing case-insensitive fallback
2. MBID test failed for Spotify data (which has no MBIDs)

**Solution**:
- Fixed `_score_candidate()` to use case-insensitive helper methods
- Made MBID test conditional on data source (only runs for Last.fm data)

## Test Results

All problematic artists now show improvement with both data sources:

**Last.fm Data:**
- ✅ *LUNA: STRONG_TRACK_MATCH (0.950)
- ✅ YOASOBI: STRONG_TRACK_MATCH (0.910) 
- ✅ IVE: STRONG_TRACK_MATCH (0.950)
- ✅ BTS: MBID_MATCH (0.990)
- ✅ Taylor Swift: MBID_MATCH (0.990)

**Spotify Data:**
- ✅ *Luna: STRONG_TRACK_MATCH (0.950)
- ✅ YOASOBI: STRONG_TRACK_MATCH (0.950)
- ✅ IVE: STRONG_TRACK_MATCH (0.950)
- ✅ BTS: STRONG_TRACK_MATCH (0.940)
- ✅ Taylor Swift: STRONG_TRACK_MATCH (0.950)

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Backward Compatibility**: Changes don't affect existing behavior for exact matches
2. **Performance**: Case-insensitive search only triggers on miss, maintaining performance
3. **Transparency**: All case-insensitive matches are logged for debugging
4. **Flexibility**: Adaptive thresholds scale with data availability
5. **Unicode Safety**: Using `casefold()` ensures proper international character handling

## Future Considerations

While Gemini suggested a complete canonicalization architecture, the implemented solution:
- Solves the immediate problem with minimal code changes
- Maintains the existing architecture
- Provides clear upgrade path if needed
- Avoids over-engineering for current requirements

The adaptive thresholds ensure the system works well for both data-rich Spotify users and data-sparse Last.fm users.
