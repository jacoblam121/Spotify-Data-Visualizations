          "content": "Taylor Alison Swift is an American singer-songwriter. Her discography spans multiple genres, and her narrative songwriting, which is often inspired by her personal life, has received widespread media coverage and critical praise.\n\nSwift rose to mainstream prominence with her sophomore studio album, Fearless (2008), a country pop record with crossover appeal. Aided by the top-five singles “Love Story” and “You Belong with Me”, Fearless was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Swift's third studio album, Speak Now (2010), blended country pop with elements of rock and featured the top-ten singles “Mine” and “Back to December”.\n\nDrawing inspiration from various pop, rock, and electronic genres, Swift's fourth studio album Red (2012) saw her transcending her country roots. She completely moved to pop with her synth-pop fifth studio album, 1989 (2014), and expanded the electropop sound on her next two studio albums, reputation (2017) and Lover (2019), which respectively embraced urban and retro styles. The four albums spawned a string of international top-five singles, including “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together”, “I Knew You Were Trouble”, “Shake It Off”, “Blank Space”, “Bad Blood”, “Look What You Made Me Do”, “ME! (feat. Brendon Urie of Panic! at the Disco)”, “You Need to Calm Down”, and “Lover”.\n\nIn the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, Swift experimented with folk and alternative rock on her eighth and ninth studio albums, folklore and evermore (both 2020), whose lead singles “cardigan” and “willow” topped charts around the world. She also released the critically acclaimed documentaries Miss Americana and Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions that year. Swift's tenth studio album, Midnights (2022), marked her triumphant return to pop after two folk albums. The album set the record for biggest first day and first week ever on Spotify, spawned the hits Anti-Hero and Lavender Haze, and sold over 1.5 million copies in its first week becoming not only the biggest debut of the decade but also Swift's biggest debut ever. She would make history by becoming the first artist to occupy the entire top ten of the Billboard Hot 100 with tracks from Midnights.\n\nAdditionally, Swift began re-recording her back catalog in November 2020 as a result of a publicized dispute with talent manager Scooter Braun and her former label Big Machine, regarding the acquisition of the masters of her back catalog. In April 2021, Swift released a re-recorded issue of her 2008 album Fearless, titled Fearless (Taylor's Version). It debuted at number one in the US. Swift continued releasing re-recorded versions of her back catalog in November, 2021 with the release of Red (Taylor's Version), a 30 track re-issue of her 2012 critical smash. The album debuted at #1 in the US, spawned the #1 hit All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor's Version) (From the Vault), and broke the record at the time for biggest first day for a female album on Spotify. Red (Taylor's Version) was a critical and commercial hit, and proved that Swift's ambitious, yet ongoing plan to re-record her first 6 albums was well worth it.\n\nAlong with the release of Red (Taylor's Version) came All Too Well: The Short Film (2021), Swift's filmmaking debut. The 15 minute romantic drama was based on the lyrical content from Swift's 2012 fan favorite “All Too Well” starring Sadie Sink and Dylan O'Brien. It had a limited theatrical release in major cities, and Swift held special screenings of the film throughout 2022 at various film festivals. In December, 2022 Taylor announced that she would be making her feature directorial debut with Oscar-winning studio Searchlight Pictures.\n\nFollowing the release of Midnights, Swift would embark on her first tour in five years, The Eras Tour—a retrospective tour covering the entirety of her discography. During her ongoing tour, Swift would release her next two re-recorded albums, Speak Now (Taylor's Version) in July and 1989 (Taylor's Version) in October of 2023. The former of which would land Swift as the woman with the most number-one albums (12) in Billboard 200 history, surpassing Barbra Streisand. The latter was her sixth album to sell one million copies in a single week in the US, her largest album sales in a week span. “Is It Over Now? (Taylor's Version)”, the lead single for 1989 (Taylor's Version), would peak at number one on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nAt the 66th annual GRAMMY Awards, Taylor Swift surprised viewers by announcing her eleventh studio album, THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT. On April 19, 2024, the album was released globally, breaking records: it became the first ever to amass 1 billion Spotify streams in a week and sold 2.6 million units in its first week in the US. Swift dominated the charts, monopolizing the top 14 spots on the Billboard Hot 100 and securing the top 10 positions on Australia’s ARIA Singles Chart. The lead single, Fortnight, featuring Post Malone, quickly soared to the number-one position on the Hot 100. Additionally, just two hours after the album’s release, Swift surprised fans with a reissue titled THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT: THE ANTHOLOGY, which included 15 extra songs.\n\nSwift has released several songs for film soundtracks. She co-wrote two songs for the Hannah Montana: The Movie soundtrack— “You'll Always Find Your Way Back Home” and “Crazier”, and contributed two songs to the Valentine's Day soundtrack, including the single “Today Was a Fairytale”, which was her first number one on the Canadian Hot 100, and peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. She also contributed two original songs to The Hunger Games soundtrack album: “Safe & Sound - from The Hunger Games Soundtrack”, co-written and recorded with The Civil Wars and T-Bone Burnett, and “Eyes Open”. “Safe & Sound” won the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. In 2013, Swift recorded “Sweeter than Fiction”, a song she wrote and produced with Jack Antonoff for the One Chance film soundtrack, which received a Best Original Song nomination at the 71st Golden Globe Awards. Swift and English singer Zayn Malik, mononymously known as Zayn, released a single together, “I Don't Wanna Live Forever”, for the soundtrack of the film Fifty Shades Darker (2017). She also recorded an original song called “Beautiful Ghosts”, which she wrote with Andrew Lloyd Webber for the Cats's soundtrack (2019). In 2020, Swift's documentary Miss Americana featured the song “Only the Young” which was written after the 2018 United States elections. In 2022, she released an original song titled “Carolina” for Where The Crawdads Sing (2022) inspired by the novel written by Delia Owens.\n\nWith sales of over 200 million records worldwide, Swift is a best-selling music artist. Her accolades include 14 Grammy Awards, including four Album of the Year wins, which makes Swift the artist with the most awards for that category in history, two Brit Awards (including a Global Icon award), an Emmy Award, 28 Guinness World Records, 32 American Music Awards (the most wins by an artist), and 23 Billboard Music Awards (the most wins by a woman). She ranked eighth on Billboard's Greatest of All Time Artists Chart (2019) and was listed on Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time (2015). Swift has been included in various power rankings, such as Time's annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world (2010, 2015 and 2019) and Forbes Celebrity 100 (placing first in 2016 and 2019). She was named Woman of the Decade (2010s) by Billboard, Artist of the Decade (2010s) by the American Music Awards, and Person of the Year (2023) by Time Magazine. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Taylor+Swift\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

          "content": "Taylor Alison Swift is an American singer-songwriter. Her discography spans multiple genres, and her narrative songwriting, which is often inspired by her personal life, has received widespread media coverage and critical praise.\n\nSwift rose to mainstream prominence with her sophomore studio album, Fearless (2008), a country pop record with crossover appeal. Aided by the top-five singles “Love Story” and “You Belong with Me”, Fearless was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Swift's third studio album, Speak Now (2010), blended country pop with elements of rock and featured the top-ten singles “Mine” and “Back to December”.\n\nDrawing inspiration from various pop, rock, and electronic genres, Swift's fourth studio album Red (2012) saw her transcending her country roots. She completely moved to pop with her synth-pop fifth studio album, 1989 (2014), and expanded the electropop sound on her next two studio albums, reputation (2017) and Lover (2019), which respectively embraced urban and retro styles. The four albums spawned a string of international top-five singles, including “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together”, “I Knew You Were Trouble”, “Shake It Off”, “Blank Space”, “Bad Blood”, “Look What You Made Me Do”, “ME! (feat. Brendon Urie of Panic! at the Disco)”, “You Need to Calm Down”, and “Lover”.\n\nIn the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, Swift experimented with folk and alternative rock on her eighth and ninth studio albums, folklore and evermore (both 2020), whose lead singles “cardigan” and “willow” topped charts around the world. She also released the critically acclaimed documentaries Miss Americana and Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions that year. Swift's tenth studio album, Midnights (2022), marked her triumphant return to pop after two folk albums. The album set the record for biggest first day and first week ever on Spotify, spawned the hits Anti-Hero and Lavender Haze, and sold over 1.5 million copies in its first week becoming not only the biggest debut of the decade but also Swift's biggest debut ever. She would make history by becoming the first artist to occupy the entire top ten of the Billboard Hot 100 with tracks from Midnights.\n\nAdditionally, Swift began re-recording her back catalog in November 2020 as a result of a publicized dispute with talent manager Scooter Braun and her former label Big Machine, regarding the acquisition of the masters of her back catalog. In April 2021, Swift released a re-recorded issue of her 2008 album Fearless, titled Fearless (Taylor's Version). It debuted at number one in the US. Swift continued releasing re-recorded versions of her back catalog in November, 2021 with the release of Red (Taylor's Version), a 30 track re-issue of her 2012 critical smash. The album debuted at #1 in the US, spawned the #1 hit All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor's Version) (From the Vault), and broke the record at the time for biggest first day for a female album on Spotify. Red (Taylor's Version) was a critical and commercial hit, and proved that Swift's ambitious, yet ongoing plan to re-record her first 6 albums was well worth it.\n\nAlong with the release of Red (Taylor's Version) came All Too Well: The Short Film (2021), Swift's filmmaking debut. The 15 minute romantic drama was based on the lyrical content from Swift's 2012 fan favorite “All Too Well” starring Sadie Sink and Dylan O'Brien. It had a limited theatrical release in major cities, and Swift held special screenings of the film throughout 2022 at various film festivals. In December, 2022 Taylor announced that she would be making her feature directorial debut with Oscar-winning studio Searchlight Pictures.\n\nFollowing the release of Midnights, Swift would embark on her first tour in five years, The Eras Tour—a retrospective tour covering the entirety of her discography. During her ongoing tour, Swift would release her next two re-recorded albums, Speak Now (Taylor's Version) in July and 1989 (Taylor's Version) in October of 2023. The former of which would land Swift as the woman with the most number-one albums (12) in Billboard 200 history, surpassing Barbra Streisand. The latter was her sixth album to sell one million copies in a single week in the US, her largest album sales in a week span. “Is It Over Now? (Taylor's Version)”, the lead single for 1989 (Taylor's Version), would peak at number one on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nAt the 66th annual GRAMMY Awards, Taylor Swift surprised viewers by announcing her eleventh studio album, THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT. On April 19, 2024, the album was released globally, breaking records: it became the first ever to amass 1 billion Spotify streams in a week and sold 2.6 million units in its first week in the US. Swift dominated the charts, monopolizing the top 14 spots on the Billboard Hot 100 and securing the top 10 positions on Australia’s ARIA Singles Chart. The lead single, Fortnight, featuring Post Malone, quickly soared to the number-one position on the Hot 100. Additionally, just two hours after the album’s release, Swift surprised fans with a reissue titled THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT: THE ANTHOLOGY, which included 15 extra songs.\n\nSwift has released several songs for film soundtracks. She co-wrote two songs for the Hannah Montana: The Movie soundtrack— “You'll Always Find Your Way Back Home” and “Crazier”, and contributed two songs to the Valentine's Day soundtrack, including the single “Today Was a Fairytale”, which was her first number one on the Canadian Hot 100, and peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. She also contributed two original songs to The Hunger Games soundtrack album: “Safe & Sound - from The Hunger Games Soundtrack”, co-written and recorded with The Civil Wars and T-Bone Burnett, and “Eyes Open”. “Safe & Sound” won the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. In 2013, Swift recorded “Sweeter than Fiction”, a song she wrote and produced with Jack Antonoff for the One Chance film soundtrack, which received a Best Original Song nomination at the 71st Golden Globe Awards. Swift and English singer Zayn Malik, mononymously known as Zayn, released a single together, “I Don't Wanna Live Forever”, for the soundtrack of the film Fifty Shades Darker (2017). She also recorded an original song called “Beautiful Ghosts”, which she wrote with Andrew Lloyd Webber for the Cats's soundtrack (2019). In 2020, Swift's documentary Miss Americana featured the song “Only the Young” which was written after the 2018 United States elections. In 2022, she released an original song titled “Carolina” for Where The Crawdads Sing (2022) inspired by the novel written by Delia Owens.\n\nWith sales of over 200 million records worldwide, Swift is a best-selling music artist. Her accolades include 14 Grammy Awards, including four Album of the Year wins, which makes Swift the artist with the most awards for that category in history, two Brit Awards (including a Global Icon award), an Emmy Award, 28 Guinness World Records, 32 American Music Awards (the most wins by an artist), and 23 Billboard Music Awards (the most wins by a woman). She ranked eighth on Billboard's Greatest of All Time Artists Chart (2019) and was listed on Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time (2015). Swift has been included in various power rankings, such as Time's annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world (2010, 2015 and 2019) and Forbes Celebrity 100 (placing first in 2016 and 2019). She was named Woman of the Decade (2010s) by Billboard, Artist of the Decade (2010s) by the American Music Awards, and Person of the Year (2023) by Time Magazine. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Taylor+Swift\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

They have released six studio albums: All We Know Is Falling, RIOT!, Brand New Eyes, their first Billboard 200 chart topper Paramore, After Laughter and their grammy winning sixth studio album This is Why .\n\nParamore, as a quartet, released their debut studio album, All We Know Is Falling, in 2005. The band rose to prominence in 2007 after the release of the hit single Misery Business from their second studio album Riot!. Crushcrushcrush and  That's What You Get were released as the following singles experiencing commercial success. The band was nominated for \"Best New Artist\" at the 2008 Grammy Awards. The band announced the official line-up addition of Taylor York in June 2009 prior to the release of Brand New Eyes due later the same year. Josh Farro (guitar) and his brother Zac Farro left the band the following year, resulting in Paramore to continue as a trio.\n\nFrom 2013 to 2014, Paramore released several singles from the self-titled album, including the singles Still Into You and Ain't It Fun. The latter became the band's highest-peaking single as well as their first Top 10 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and earned the band their first Grammy award for \"Best Rock Song\" the following year. At the end of 2015, it was reported Jeremy Davis (bass guitar) left the band.\n\nIn 2017, Zac Farro officially rejoined the band, prior to the release of their fifth studio album, \"After Laughter\".\n\nIn 2023, Paramore released their 6th studio album \"This Is Why\". This is the first album in the band's history with no lineup changes. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Paramore\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

          "content": "1) Lee Ji-eun (이지은; born 16 May 1993), better known by her stage name IU (아이유), is an award-winning South Korean singer-songwriter and actress signed to EDAM Entertainment. She debuted in 2008 to much acclaim for her vocal ability but did not find mainstream success until 2010 with 잔소리 which became her first number one hit. As of 2017, IU has fourteen official #1 singles on Gaon, Korea's national chart, and four #1 singles on Billboard's K-Pop Hot 100. She also charted in the top ten of Gaon's annual singles chart for two consecutive years from 2010-2011. On top of her commercial success, her music and artistry are also critically acclaimed winning multiple Daesang awards for Song of the Year (for 좋은 날) and Artist of the Year from 2011-2012.\n\n2008: Debut\nIU debuted on a Korean music program called M! Countdown in September 18, 2008. On September 23, 2008, she released her first mini-album, Lost and Found, in which the most famous song was the title track, \"Missing Child.\" However, the album was not commercially successful. It wasn't until her follow-up album that she succeeded in breaking into the mainstream.\n\n2009\nOn April 16, 2009, IU launched her first full album, titled Growing Up, with the lead promotional number \"Boo.\" Within three weeks, \"Boo\" went up to the #1 contenders for SBS Inkigayo, and her name also went up twice on Take 7 together with other notable artists like SG Wannabe and Younha. The song also did well on KBS Music Bank K-Chart, on Mnet M!Countdown chart, and on various online music charts.\n\nIn 2009, IU sang the ending title song, \"Araro\", for the acclaimed MBC drama Queen Seon Duk, where she was recommended by the director, Sam Kim, citing her \"clear tone and her lyrical sensibility.\" She was also featured on Mighty Mouth's album Love Class in the song \"희망사항.\" In late 2009, IU recorded MC Mong's song \"Love Letter For You (Neoyege Sseuneun Pyeonji),\" featuring SHINee's Key as a rapper in the song.\n\n2010\nIU recorded the song \"잔소리\" (Nagging / Scolded) with 2AM's Seulong for the TV show We Got Married. On June 27, 2010, IU won her first award since her debut on SBS Inkigayo for \"Nagging.\" On July 2, 2010, she won another award for that song on KBS Music Bank K-Chart. Soon after, IU was chosen to sing the main OST song for the MBC drama Road No.1 titled \"여자라서\" (Because I'm A Woman). IU's other collaborations include duets with Yoo Seung Ho (\"사랑을 믿어요\" (Believe in Love)), Sung Shi Kyung (\"그대네요\" (It's You)), and Big Bang's Seungri (\"I Know\").\n\nIU worked with some of South Korea's most famous musicians and producers for her third mini-album, REAL, released in December 2010. Lee Min Soo and Kim Eana, the creators of IU's previous hit \"Nagging\", helped produce her award-winning song \"좋은 날\" (\"Good Day\"). IU received three SBS Inkigayo Mutizen awards for her performances of the song (on December 18 and December 26, 2010, and January 2, 2011), three awards from KBS Music Bank K-Chart (on December 24 and December 31, 2010, and January 7, 2011), and one award from Mnet M!Countdown on December 23, 2010.\n\n2011\nIU often covers other pop artists' songs with her guitar and features her friend Thunder from MBLAQ, most notably renditions of SHINee's \"Juliette,\" Big Bang's \"Lies,\" Super Junior's \"Sorry, Sorry\" and Girls' Generation's \"Gee.\"\n\nSoribada, an online music service, combined the music downloads and streams from January 1 to March 30, 2011, to name IU's song, \"Good Day\" as the number one song of the first quarter. Her song \"Someday\" from the KBS Drama Dream High OST and her ballad \"The Story Only I Didn't Know\" placed 4th and 7th place, respectively – showing that IU got 3 of the top 10 digital spots for the first quarter. Her first original composition, \"Dreaming\" was used in the drama \"Dream High\", but not released officially.\n\nOn June 18, 2011, IU held her first official fanmeeting and mini-concert at AX-Korea. It also marked the 1004th day since she debuted.\n\nIU also sang a self-composed OST called \"Hold my Hand\" for drama series The Greatest Love.\nOn November 29, 2011, IU's second full length album Last Fantasy was released and achieved an ‘all-kill’ as all 13 songs immediately swept most of all the charts. The track list was revealed on November 22, 2011.\n\n2012\nOn January 24, 2012, IU held a live showcase at Tokyo's Bunkamura Orchard Hall. On March 1st, 2012, she released a promotional video for the Japanese version of \"Good Day\", the title track of her Japanese single album. The album, which includes DVD footage from the showcase, was later released on March 21, 2012.\n\nIn early April, 2012, it was announced that IU will be holding her first solo tour, \"Real Fantasy\", starting in June. The tour features performances in six different cities across South Korea, including Seoul and Busan.\n\nIU released the single album, \"Spring of a Twenty Year Old\" (\"스무 살의 봄\"), on May 11th, 2012.[16] The album contains three songs, one of which is self-composed by IU. This song, entitled \"Peach\" (\"복숭아\"), was digitally released before the album, on May 4th, 2012. A 26-minute-long documentary-style music video film was released alongside the album, featuring several interviews with IU that showcase her personal thoughts and experiences. This film contains footage of IU as she visits Venice, Italy.\n\n\n2021\nOn January 11, 2021 IU, and her agency EDAM Entertainment, officially announced that they will be releasing a single from her upcoming album on January 27, 2021.\n\nOn January 27, 2021 at 18:00 KST (UTC+9) EDAM Entertainment globally released IU's comeback single entitled \"Celebrity\". The track was released in major online streaming platforms in South Korea and worldwide and achieved multiple All-Kills in Korean charts every hour. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/IU\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

They are stylistically associated with the \"girl crush\" concept in K-pop—exploring themes of self-confidence and female empowerment.\n\nBLACKPINK released their debut single album, SQUARE ONE, on August 8, 2016, consisting of tracks \"BOOMBAYAH\" and \"WHISTLE\". They charted at number one and two, respectively, on the Billboard World Digital Song Sales chart, making BLACKPINK the fastest act to achieve such a feat and the third YG Entertainment artist to hold the top two positions simultaneously, after Psy and Big Bang.\n\nBLACKPINK released their second single album, SQUARE TWO, consisting of tracks \"PLAYING WITH FIRE\" and \"STAY\", on November 1, 2016. \"PLAYING WITH FIRE\" was BLACKPINK's second single to reach number one on the Billboard World Digital Song Sales chart and the first K-pop girl group song to chart on the Billboard Canadian Hot 100. BLACKPINK's commercial success in their first five months earned them several rookie awards at major Korean year-end music award shows, including the Asia Artist Awards, Melon Music Awards, Golden Disc Awards, Seoul Music Awards, and Gaon Chart Music Awards. Additionally, Billboard named them one of the best new K-pop groups of 2016.\n\nOn January 17, 2017, BLACKPINK revealed the name of their fan club — \"BLINK\", a portmanteau of \"black\" and \"pink\". On June 22, the group released their first standalone digital single, \"AS IF IT'S YOUR LAST\". It was described as a \"mixed genre of music\" and a change of sound from their previous releases. The song peaked at number three on the Gaon Digital Chart and at number 13 on Billboard's Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart, becoming their first song to enter the Bubbling Under Hot 100.\n\nOn June 15, 2018, the group released their first Korean-language EP, SQUARE UP. In South Korea, the EP debuted at number one on Gaon Album Chart and was certified platinum by the Korea Music Content Association (KMCA) for selling 250,000 units. SQUARE UP brought the group their first entry and the highest-charting album by a female Korean group at the time of its release on the Billboard 200, debuting at number 40. The EP also topped the Billboard World Albums chart and led BLACKPINK to becoming the first female Korean group to top the Billboard Emerging Artists chart. The EP's lead single, \"DDU-DU DDU-DU\", peaked at number one on the Gaon Digital Chart while \"Forever Young\" peaked at number two. In the United States, \"DDU-DU DDU-DU\" debuted at number 55 on the Billboard Hot 100 and became the highest-charting song by a Korean girl group in the country, surpassing the record set by \"Nobody\" by Wonder Girls in 2009. It additionally marked the first time a Korean girl group entered the US Streaming Songs chart, entering at number 39. The song was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in August 2019, making Blackpink the first Korean girl group to receive a certification in the country. In the United Kingdom, \"DDU-DU DDU-DU\" debuted at number 78 on the UK Singles Chart and made Blackpink the first ever female Korean group to enter the chart. YouTube's official tally saw the music video for \"DDU-DU DDU-DU\" garner a total of 36.2 million views within 24 hours after its release, making it the most-viewed online video in the first 24 hours by a Korean act and the second most-watched music video of all time in first 24 hours of release at the time.\n\nOn October 19, 2018, English singer Dua Lipa released \"Kiss and Make Up\" with Blackpink, a new track on the re-released edition of her self-titled debut album. \"Kiss and Make Up\" became the group's second entry in the UK Singles Chart, peaking at number 36, which became the first time a female Korean group reached the top 40. It also debuted at number 93 on the Billboard Hot 100, marking BLACKPINK's second entry in the chart and making them the only Korean girl group to score multiple entries on the chart. The song was certified silver in the UK by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), marking the first time a Korean group received a certification in the UK.\n\nBLACKPINK's third extended play, KILL THIS LOVE, was released on April 5, 2019, alongside a single of the same name. In South Korea, the EP debuted at number three on the Gaon Album Chart and was certified 2× platinum by the KMCA for selling 500,000 units in the country, while the lead single peaked at number two on the Gaon Digital Chart and was certified platinum for surpassing 100,000,000 streams in the country.  KILL THIS LOVE also debuted at number 24 on the Billboard 200, while the lead single reached number 41 on the Hot 100, becoming the highest-charting releases by a female Korean group on the two major Billboard charts. The EP also became BLACKPINK's second number-one album on the Billboard World Albums chart. The song's music video broke the record for the most views within 24 hours on YouTube, accumulating 56.7 million views in that time. \"Kill This Love\" ranked at number 66 on Billboard's list of the 100 Best Songs of 2019.\n\nFollowing the EP's release, BLACKPINK performed at the 2019 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival on April 12 and 19, 2019, making them the first female K-pop group to do so. The group's Coachella set was well received by both critics and fans alike, with Gab Ginsberg of Billboard calling the show \"electrifying\" and \"unforgettable\".\n\nOn April 22, 2020, it was confirmed the group would be working with Lady Gaga on her sixth studio album, Chromatica.

Dreamcatcher (드림캐쳐) is a South Korean girl group known for integrating horror and fantasy themes with rock and metal elements into K-pop consisting of JiU, SuA, Siyeon, Handong,Yoohyeon, Dami and Gahyun. The group was formed by Happy Face Entertainment in 2014 as a five-member act called MINX (밍스), featuring JiU, SuA, Siyeon, Yoohyeon, and Dami In contrast to Dreamcatcher’s later style, MINX’s music followed a more typical bright, bubblegum pop approach that was moderately successful. In November 2016, the group announced a rebranding under the new name Dreamcatcher, adding two new members, Handong and Gahyun, and adopting a dark fantasy aesthetic to stand out within the K-pop scene. Dreamcatcher officially debuted with this lineup on January 13, 2017, with 악몽and the title track Chase Me, which introduced their unique blend of K-pop and rock elements.\n\nBuilding on their unique style, Dreamcatcher continued the Nightmare series with additional releases, including Fall Asleep in the Mirror (April 2017) and Prequel (July 2017) with the title tracks GOOD NIGHT and Fly High. This darker concept found immediate popularity, earning them a dedicated fanbase, especially among international audiences. Their music began to chart in both Japan and the United States, where their releases began appearing on Billboard’s World Albums chart. Celebrating their first anniversary in 2018, Dreamcatcher released the digital single \"Full Moon,\" which charted internationally on the iTunes Top 100 K-pop charts. That year, they embarked on their first European tour, showcasing their growing appeal outside of South Korea. Following their success in Europe, they released their second EP, Nightmare - Escape The ERA and the title track YOU AND I , and subsequently performed in Latin America as part of the Welcome to the Dream World tour.\n\nIn 2019, Dreamcatcher concluded their Nightmare series with the End of Nightmare EP, featuring the lead single \"Piri,\" which fused rock elements with the traditional Korean piri instrument. That September, they released their first Japanese album, The Beginning of the End, which included Japanese versions of their popular songs and original tracks like “Breaking Out.” This was followed by the EP Raid of Dream, a collaboration with the mobile game King’s Raid, which featured the single \"Deja Vu.\" The same year, they expanded their global reach with another European tour.\n\nDreamcatcher entered 2020 with the release of their first full-length Korean album, Dystopia: The Tree of Language which reached number three on the Gaon Album Chart. The album began their dystopian-themed Dystopia trilogy, followed by the EPs Dystopia: Lose Myself in August 2020 and Dystopia: Road to Utopia in January 2021 with the title tracks BOCA and Odd Eye. Due to travel restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, member Handong, who was in China, could not participate in the first two Dystopia releases. In March 2021, Dreamcatcher released \"Eclipse\" as the second opening for the anime adaptation of King’s Raid, further solidifying their appeal within anime and gaming circles. That July, they released the special EP [Summer Holiday], with its lead single “BEcause,” which gained additional popularity at the Tokyo Olympics, where it was played during various Korean matches.\n\nIn 2022, Dreamcatcher returned with their second full-length album, Apocalypse: Save Us which included the title track \"MAISON\" and marked their first number-one win on South Korean music shows. This album also included individual solo tracks for each member, adding a personal touch to their discography. Following this release, the group released Apocalypse: Follow Us in October 2022.\n\nOn January 13, 2023, Dreamcatcher commemorated their sixth anniversary with the digital single \"REASON.\" In May, they concluded their Apocalypse series with the album Apocalypse: From Us, featuring the title track \"BONVOYAGE,\" which earned them additional music show wins. Later in the year, Dreamcatcher debuted their new VersuS storyline with the release of the EP VillainS on November 22, 2023, led by the single \"OOTD,\" which presented a satirical take on the K-pop “girl crush” concept.\n\nFor their seventh anniversary in early 2024, Dreamcatcher held a world tour where they introduced new concert arrangements of songs like “The Curse of Spider” and “Lullaby.” In July, they released the next EP VirtuouS, marking a conceptual counterpart to VillainS, featuring the single “Justice”.\n\nOn December 20, 2024 Dreamcatcher released their first Christmas song with \"My Christmas Sweet Love\" which blended a softer style with Dreamcatcher's signature rock sound. They also released two remakes of their older songs \"Jazz Bar\" and \"Wonderland\" called Carol versions. \n\n2. Dreamcatcher (aka Paul Castle and Simon Langford) are a UK dance/trance act. \n\n3.

          "content": "Bring Me the Horizon, often known by the acronym BMTH, are a British deathcore / metalcore band formed in 2004 in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, by vocalist Oliver Sykes, drummer Matt Nicholls, bassist Matt Kean, and guitarists Lee Malia and Curtis Ward.\n\nThe current lineup of the band consists of: Oliver \"Oli\" Sykes (lead vocals, keyboards and programming), Matt Nicholls (drums), Lee Malia (lead and rythm guitar), Matt Kean (bass) and touring member John Jones (rythm guitar and backing vocals).\n\nThey are signed to RCA Records globally and Columbia Records exclusively in the United States. The style of their early work, including their debut album Count Your Blessings, has primarily been described as melodic deathcore, but they started to adopt a more eclectic style of metalcore on subsequent albums. Furthermore, their latest two albums That's the Spirit and amo marked a shift in their sound to less aggressive rock/metal music styles, such as alternative rock, pop rock, and alternative metal.\n\nHistory\nBring Me the Horizon's founding members came from diverse musical backgrounds within metal and rock. Matt Nicholls and Oliver Sykes had a common interest in American metalcore such as Norma Jean and Skycamefalling, and used to attend local hardcore punk shows. They later met Lee Malia, who spoke with them about thrash metal and melodic death metal bands like Metallica and At the Gates; Malia had also been part of a Metallica tribute band before meeting the pair. Bring Me the Horizon officially formed in March 2004, when the members were aged 15 to 17. Curtis Ward, who also lived in the Rotherham area, joined Sykes, Malia and Nicholls. Bassist Matt Kean, who was in other local bands, completed the line-up. Their name was taken from the line in the film Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, where Captain Jack Sparrow says \"Now, bring me that horizon.\"\n\nIn the months following their formation, Bring Me the Horizon created a demo album titled Bedroom Sessions. They followed this by releasing their first EP, This Is What the Edge of Your Seat Was Made For in September 2004 through local UK label Thirty Days of Night Records. Bring Me the Horizon were the label's first signing. It was recorded at Pristine Studios in Nottingham over the course of two weekends, with drums and bass guitar laid down over the first weekend, and guitars and vocals completed a week later.\n\nUK label Visible Noise noticed the band after the release of their EP, and signed them for a four-album deal, in addition to re-releasing the EP in January 2005. The re-release gained the band significant attention, eventually peaking at No. 41 on the UK album charts. The band was later awarded Best British Newcomer at the 2006 Kerrang! Awards ceremony.\n\nThe band's first tour was supporting The Red Chord across the United Kingdom. As with other early tours, they were able to get this slot by tricking venue promoters. Kean and Oliver's mother were the de facto managers of the band at this time, a role they continued to occupy until 2008. For The Red Chord support, Kean emailed promoters and pretended they were opening on all the dates, when they were supposed to play only at their local show. This led them to being booked for the whole tour. In another case, Sykes created an e-mail account in the name of Johnny Truant vocalist Oliver Mitchell, which he used to contact a promoter requesting Bring Me the Horizon on their tour. Alcohol consumption fuelled their live performances in their early history when the band would get so drunk they vomited on stage and damaged their equipment.\n\nThe band released their debut album Count Your Blessings in October 2006 in the United Kingdom and in August 2007 in the United States. They rented a house in the country to write songs, but easily became distracted. They then recorded the album in inner-city Birmingham, a process which was infamous for their excessive and dangerous drinking. During this period drummer Nicholls summarised it saying \"we were out every night, just being regular 18-year-olds\". Critics panned the album adding to the strongly polarised responses the band were already seeing from the public.\n\nBring Me the Horizon recorded their second studio album, Suicide Season, in Sweden with producer Fredrik Nordström. He was unimpressed with their first album and was initially absent from the recording sessions unless he needed to be there. Nordström later heard the new sound they were experimenting with during a recording session and became very involved in the record. It was promoted virally in the weeks before its release with the promotional tag line \"September is Suicide Season.\"\n\nDuring the Taste of Chaos tour in March of that year, guitarist Curtis Ward left the band. His relationship with the band had deteriorated as his stage performances were poor. He was abusive to audiences during the Taste of Chaos tour, and had contributed little to the writing of Suicide Season. Another reason for his departure was the worsening tinnitus in his one functioning ear. Ward was born deaf in one ear and admitted playing in the band worsened the ringing in his other ear to such a degree that he was unable to sleep at night. Ward offered to perform the rest of the tour dates, which the band rejected and instead asked their guitar technician, Dean Rowbotham, to substitute for him for the remaining performances. Lee Malia noted that Ward's departure helped improve everyone's mood as he had been very negative. Within a week of the tour finishing, Sykes began talking to Jona Weinhofen, at the time the guitarist of Bleeding Through. The band knew of him from his work with his former band I Killed the Prom Queen, and he was asked to join them. Ward has since worked on the TV show Top Gear, and has occasionally performed on stage with Bring Me The Horizon, playing Pray For Plagues, most notably at Wembley Arena in 2015. In 2016, it was announced that Ward had joined the band Counting Days.\n\nIn November 2009, Bring Me the Horizon released a remixed version of Suicide Season, titled Suicide Season: Cut Up!. Musicians and producers featured on the album include: Ben Weinman (from the Dillinger Escape Plan), Skrillex, L’Amour La Morgue, Utah Saints and Shawn Crahan (from Slipknot). Musically, the album incorporates many genres including: electronica, drum and bass, hip-hop and dubstep. The dubstep style of the record has been acknowledged in tracks by Tek-One and Skrillex while the hip-hop elements are found in Travis McCoy's remix of Chelsea Smile.\n\nThe band's third album, and first with their new rhythm guitarist Jona Weinhofen, titled There Is a Hell, Believe Me I've Seen It. There Is a Heaven, Let's Keep It a Secret, was released on 4 October 2010 and debuted at number 17 on the Billboard 200 in the United States, number 13 on the UK Album Chart, and number one on the Australian Albums Chart, the UK Rock Chart and the UK Indie Chart. Despite reaching number one in Australia, the album's sales were the lowest for a number one album in the history of the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) charts.\n\nMatt Nicholls describes the lyrical themes of There Is a Hell as being \"repercussions of everything we were singing about on our last CD (Suicide Season)\" calling the music and lyrics a lot moodier and darker. Five singles were released from the album including: It Never Ends, Anthem, Blessed with a Curse, Visions and Alligator Blood, with music videos produced for each of the songs. \n\n2011 ended with an announcement by the band on 29 December of a new extended play titled The Chill Out Sessions, a collaborative effort with British DJ Draper. Draper first released an \"officially sanctioned\" remix of the song Blessed with a Curse in May 2011. The EP was originally supposed to be released in time for New Year's Day, and made available for download and purchase though Bring Me the Horizon's website, but the EP's release was cancelled due to the band's \"current management and label situation\".\n\nAfter an intense touring schedule, Bring Me the Horizon finally completed their third album's promotion at the end of 2011. They returned to the UK for an extended break and eventually starting work on their next album. Much like their previous two albums, they wrote their fourth album in seclusion and isolation to stay focused. This time, they retreated to a house in the Lake District. In July, the band started to publish images of themselves recording at a \"Top Secret Studio Location\" and revealed they were working with producer Terry Date for the recording and production of the album. On 30 July, the band announced they had left their label and signed with RCA, who would release their fourth album in 2013.  In late October it was announced that the fourth album would be called Sempiternal with a tentative release in early 2013. On 22 November the band released the Draper collaborative album The Chill Out Sessions free of charge.\n\nOn 4 January 2013, Bring Me the Horizon released the first single from Sempiternal, Shadow Moses. It was first played by radio presenter Daniel P. Carter on BBC's Radio 1. Due to popular demand, Epitaph released the music video for the song a week earlier than planned. In January, the band also saw a change in their line up. This began early in the month when Jordan Fish, Worship keyboardist and session musician for the band during the writing of Sempiternal, was announced as a full member. Then later in the month, Jona Weinhofen left the band. Despite the band denying speculation that Fish replaced Weinhofen, reviewers said that replacing a guitarist with a keyboardist better fit their style. The album was released the 1st of march, 2013. The album was supported by multiple music videos including those for the tracks Go to Hell, for Heaven's Sake, Sleepwalking and Can You Feel My Heart. The lyrics on Sempiternal mainly deal with Sykes' journey through rehabilitation from ketamine.\n\nLater in 2014, the band released two new tracks titled Drown on 21 October, as a stand-alone single, and Don't Look Down on 29 October, as part of the re-score of Drive.\n\nIn late June, the band began to promote pictures of an umbrella symbol being used as a tattoo, and on stickers, and posters across England, the United States, Australia, and Europe; it was later used for a promotional cover for the band's first single. The band released a short video in early July where the words \"that's the spirit\" could be heard in reverse. On 13 July 2015, the promotional single Happy Song was released on the band's Vevo page, and on 21 July 2015, Sykes revealed the album's name was That's the Spirit. The band released the single and music video for Throne on 23 July 2015, and another promotional track from the album, titled \"True Friends\", was released on 24 August 2015. The album was released on 11 September 2015 to critical acclaim. It has led to several music videos including Drown, Throne, True Friends, Follow You, Avalanche and  Oh No.\n\nOn 22 April 2016, the band performed a live concert with an orchestra conducted by Simon Dobson at the Royal Albert Hall in London. The concert marked the first time the band had performed with a live orchestra. It was recorded, and the live album, Live At The Royal Albert Hall, was released on 2 December 2016 through the crowdfunding platform PledgeMusic on CD, DVD, and vinyl, with all proceeds donated to Teenage Cancer Trust.\n\nIn August 2018, cryptic posters appeared in major cities throughout the world with the message \"do you wanna start a cult with me?\". The posters were attributed by major media outlets to the band only by their use of the hexagram logo previously used by the band. During this time the band themselves have not acknowledged their involvement with the campaign publicly. Each poster provided a unique phone number and a website address. The website provided a brief message titled \"An Invitation To Salvation\" and shows the date of 21 August 2018. The phone lines placed fans on hold with lengthy, varied audio messages that changed frequently. Some of these messages reportedly end with a distorted audio clip of what was assumed to be new music from the band.\n\nOn 21 August, the band released the lead single Mantra. The following day the band announced their new album amo set for release on 11 January 2019 along with a new set of tour dates called the First Love World Tour. On 21 October, the band released their second single wonderful life (feat. Dani Filth) featuring Dani Filth, along with the tracklist for amo. That same day, the band announced that the album has been delayed and is now set for 25 January 2019. On 3 January 2019, the band released their third single medicine and its corresponding music video.\n\nDiscography\nStudio albums\nCount Your Blessings (2006)Suicide Season (2008)There Is a Hell Believe Me I've Seen It.

          "content": "There are multiple artists using this name:\n\n1. The Killers are an American  alternative rock band from Las Vegas, Nevada, formed in 2001. \nThey got the name from the fictional band The Killers in the video for New Order's song Crystal. \nAs of 2021, the band has released six studio albums, which have sold 28 million records worldwide. \n\nThe Early Years\nInitially, The Killers played at large clubs in Las Vegas. With the band's line-up stable and their repertoire of songs expanding, the band began to attract attention from talent bookers, local agents, major label, scouts — and a UK representative for Warner Bros. Though the Warner Bros representative passed on the band, he took the demo back with him, showing it to a friend who worked at UK (London-based) indie label Lizard King Records (now Marrakesh Records). The Killers then signed in the summer of 2002 to a British label.\n\nHot Fuss\nThey released their debut album Hot Fuss on June 2004 in the United Kingdom and US (on Island Records). Their first single was Somebody Told Me. The band also had chart success with their singles Mr. Brightside, which reached the Top 10 in the UK when released, and All These Things That I've Done.\n\nSam's Town\nThe band started recording its second album, Sam's Town, on February 15, 2006, at The Palms Hotel/Casino in Las Vegas. It was released on October 2006. \nThe first single, When You Were Young debuted on radio stations in late July 2006. In late August 2006, it was offered as a downloadable track before the album's debut. The single then entered the chart on downloads alone at #5, and the following week on its official release went to #2 in the UK. \nThe video clip of the second single, Bones, was directed by Tim Burton. \nThe third single was Read My Mind. The video for it was filmed in Tokyo, Japan. \nThe last one was For Reasons Unknown, released in June, 2007.\nThe album sold over 700,000 copies worldwide in the first week of release, with a No. 2 debut on the United World chart. \n\nSawdust Compilation\nThe compilation album Sawdust, containing B-sides, rarities, and some new material, was released on November 12, 2007. \nThe album's first single Tranquilize, a collaboration with Lou Reed, was released on October 2007. The band also released their cover of Joy Division's song Shadowplay on the U.S. iTunes Store. The album contains songs Ruby, Don't Take Your Love to Town (a The First Edition cover), Romeo and Juliet (a Dire Straits cover), and a new version of Move Away (previously available on the Spider-Man 3 soundtrack). One of the tracks on Sawdust is Leave the Bourbon On The Shelf, the first but previously unreleased part of the so called Murder Trilogy, in which it is followed by Midnight Show then Jenny Was a Friend of Mine.\n\n(Red) Christmas EP\nIn 2006 Songfacts reported that The Killers were recognized for their work with Bono's Product Red campaign, which is dedicated to fighting AIDS in Africa. \nIn the same year they have released their first Christmas themed song and music video, A Great Big Sled in aid of the charity, followed by Don't Shoot Me Santa on December 1, 2007. \nTheir festive tunes have subsequently became an annual event and (Red) Christmas EP intended to raise money for the Product Red campaign on November 29, 2011.\n\nDay & Age\nThe third album Day & Age was released on 25th November 2008 (24th November for the UK). \nThe album's first single Human was debuted on 22nd September and on the 30th September, the single was made available on iTunes, with many radio DJ's suggesting it was the best single by The Killers yet.\nKillers frontman Brandon Flowers said (in December 2008) that he thinks that his band \"will be bigger than U2 eventually, and sooner than you might think\". He told The Daily Telegraph that \"U2 are unbelievable, but they're getting old. It feels like it's time\". \nThe album was reviewed at Silent Soundwaves.\n\nBattle Born\nThe band was on hiatus, but returned to the studio to record their fourth studio album in early 2011. Songfacts reported that Runaways, the first single from the new album, was released on July 10, 2012. \nThe Killers' fourth studio album, Battle Born, was released on 18 September 2012. \nIt took 15 months to record it. The band began working on it after they took a touring break for a little over a year. The album had five producers, with The Killers producing one song by themselves, The Rising Tide. \nThe debut single was Runaways, followed by Miss Atomic Bomb and Here with Me.\n\nWonderful Wonderful\nIn 2015, Brandon Flowers and Dave Keuning began to discuss recording a fifth studio album. The band recorded the album between September 2016 and May 2017, with production by Jacknife Lee. Band members Dave Keuning and  Mark Stoermer both announced that they would take a break from touring. The Killers' fifth studio album,  Wonderful Wonderful, was released on September 22, 2017, debuting at #1 on the Billboard 200. Stoermer\n\nImploding the Mirage\nOn November 15, 2019, the Killers announced their sixth studio album titled Imploding the Mirage for a Spring 2020 release. On March 12, 2020, the album's lead single \"Caution\" was released, featuring a guitar solo by former Fleetwood Mac guitarist Lindsey Buckingham. Buckingham said of the band, \"There’s such a strong center to what they’re doing. Their material is so well crafted that it cuts across a lot of generational lines.\" Brandon Flowers also confirmed that guitarist Dave Keuning was still on hiatus and did not participate in recording the album. On April 25, 2020, \"Caution\" reached number one on Billboard's Alternative Songs chart, setting a record of 13 years and 6 months since the band's last number-one song on the chart.\n\nThe Killers' sixth studio album, \" Imploding the Mirage\" was released on August 21, 2020. It debuted at #8 on the Billboard 200.\n\nInfluences\nMuch of The Killers' music is based on British influences and on the music of the 1980s, particularly New Wave. Flowers has also said in interviews that the larger-than-life sound of many of the band's songs is due to the influence of living in Las Vegas, a city where everything is about flash and who can top whom. They appreciate post-punk bands that sprang up during the 80's such as Joy Division, and they are also avowed fans of New Order (with whom Flowers has performed live), Pet Shop Boys, Radiohead, David Bowie, The Smiths, Morrissey, Depeche Mode, U2, Queen, Muse and Linkin Park. Their second album was said to be greatly influenced by Bruce Springsteen's music and lyrics.\n\nTheir line-up is:\nBrandon Flowers (vocals, keyboards), \nDave Keuning (guitar, backing vocals), \nMark Stoermer (bass guitar, backing vocals),\nRonnie Vannucci Jr. (drums, percussion). \n\n2. The Killers were an Uruguayan rock band from the early 1970s which released an album Good Bye in 1972.\n\n3. The Killers were n American hardcore band from Chicago, IL, from the 1990s founded by former members of Charles Bronson. \nThey released records on Hater of God and Gloom, and had split records with A.P.B. & 9 Shocks Terror. \nReminds of Behead The Prophet No Lord Shall Live meets The Oath.\n\n4. The Killers (aka Insanity and The Killers) were an American band from Cleveland, Ohio. They released one 7″ on Huh? Oh? in 1981.\n\n5. The Killers were a British punk rock band from England formed in 1977 (though released their first 7\",  I Don't Care, as Joe Cool & The Killers). In 1978 they released their one and only album called Killer; by then they had dropped the Joe Cool and released the record under this name.  \n\n6.

The band members were João Bosco (drums), Luiz Carlos (bass guitar), João Carlos (lead guitar), and Gustavo (rhythm guitar) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Killers\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
